                                            <br>I met her in a club down in old Soho
                                            <br>Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like coca cola
                                            <br>C-O-L-A, Cola
                                                            <br>
                                            <br>She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
                                            <br>I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola
                                            <br>L-O-L-A, Lola
                                            <br>La-la-la-la Lola

                                            <br>Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy
                                            <br>But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine
                                            <br>Oh my Lola
                                            <br>La-la-la-la Lola
                                                            <br>
                                            <br>Well, I'm not dumb but I can't understand
                                            <br>Why she walked like a woman but talked like a man
                                            <br>Oh my Lola
                                            <br>La-la-la-la Lola
                                            <br>La-la-la-la Lola

                                            <br>Well, we drank champagne and     danced all night
                                            <br>Under electric candlelight
                                            <br>She picked me up and sat me on her knee
                                            <br>And said "Dear boy, won't you come home with me?"
                                                            <br>
                                            <br>Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy
                                            <br>But when I looked in her eyes, well I almost fell for my Lola
                                            <br>La-la-la-la Lola
                                            <br>La-la-la-la Lola

                                            <br>Lola
                                            <br>La-la-la-la Lola
                                            <br>La-la-la-la Lola
                                                            <br>
                                            <br>I pushed her away
                                            <br>I walked to the door
                                            <br>I fell to the floor
                                            <br>I got down on my knees
                                            <br>Then I looked at her and she at me
                                                            <br>
                                            <br>Well, that's the way that I want it to stay
                                            <br>And I always want it to be that way for my Lola
                                            <br>La-la-la-la Lola
                                                            <br>
                                            <br>Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
                                            <br>It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world, except for Lola
                                            <br>La-la-la-la Lola
                                                            <br>
                                            <br>Well, I left home just a week before
                                            <br>And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
                                            <br>But Lola smiled and took me by the hand
                                            <br>And said "Dear boy, I'm gonna make you a man"
                                                            <br>
                                            <br>Well, I'm not the world's most masculine man
                                            <br>But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man
                                            <br>And so is Lola
                                            <br>La-la-la-la Lola
                                            <br>La-la-la-la Lola
